        Display current action status on the status info widget.
        
        Handled scenarios:
        - Idle
        - Collect (Mining, Woodcutting, Gathering plants)
        - Fishing
        - Eat
        - Play Instrument
        - Rest
        - Sleep
        - Fighting
        
        Does not handle well:
        - Click and hold to walk, still shows as idle
        - Walk short distances like adjacent tiles
        - Distinguish Mining from Woodcutting actions, it's considered as Collect by the game
